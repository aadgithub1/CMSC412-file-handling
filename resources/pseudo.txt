User Interface
    Allow the user to select a number
        print the number options
        print a message directing the user to make a selection
        use a scanner to recieve the user's input
        print the number to ensure proper data capture

        Only allow user to select numbers 0-5
            convert user input to String
                handle any exceptions this may raise
            verify the input is between 0 and 5 inclusive
                if so return

Model
    Perform an operation based on user input
    Create a place for the file path to be stored to verify validity: File file

    if inp == 0
        print exit message
    if inp == 1
        do path = getPath()
        while(file == null) //or some other check for validity

        TO-DO:
        Decide whether to error check for null in loop in main

    if inp == 2
        make sure path exists
        create arraylists for directories and files (separate)
        print hierarchy
            walk files
            if file is regular file
                add to files arrlist
            else add to directories arrlist
            
    
    if inp == 3
        verify valid path is being used
        set the path as the root/where we will look within
        get file name
            use scanner to get file name
            make sure file exists
            if so
                assign the value to currentFile

        if file exists in the assigned path
            print contents of that file
                byte[] = Files.readAllBytes(currentFile)
                for each byte
                    printf with "%02X " hex format
                    if index % 16 == 0
                        println / newline
        else
            tell user file does not exist
            prompt again

    if inp == 4
        verify valid path is being used
        get file name
        if file exists in hierarchy
            delete that file
        else
            tell user file does not exist
            prompt again
    
    if inp == 5
        verify valid path is being used
        get file name
        if file exists in hierarchy
            mirror bytes

            byte[] currentFileBytes = getCurrentFileBytes()
            byte[] mirroredBytes = new byte[currentFileBytes]
            
            for i = currentFileBytes.length; i > 0; i--
                mirroredBytes[currentFileBytes.length - i] = currentFileBytes[i-1]

            overwrite the current file with the mirrored bytes
                create FileOutputStream = null
                in the mirror method
                    FileOutputStream byteOutputStream = new FileOutputStream(currentFile)
                    byteOutputStream.write(mirrorCurrentFileBytes)

        else
            tell user file does not exist
            prompt again


Make it an infinite loop menu from which the user can choose
and continually re-assign files and directories

what do we want?
    user hits any number 2-5 and is told they have to put in a directory
    user hits any number 3-5 and is told they need to put in a file
    requested operation is carried out when both are assigned valid values
    info is displayed

    menu is displayed again
    the user can perform another operation on the same file
    or choose a new dir (option 1) 

    does the above require a new file to be selected or will it be auto
    because Files.exists(old/file/in/new/dir)
