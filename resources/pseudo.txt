User Interface
    Allow the user to select a number
        print the number options
        print a message directing the user to make a selection
        use a scanner to recieve the user's input
        print the number to ensure proper data capture

        Only allow user to select numbers 0-5
            convert user input to String
                handle any exceptions this may raise
            verify the input is between 0 and 5 inclusive
                if so return

Model
    Perform an operation based on user input
    Create a place for the file path to be stored to verify validity: File file

    if inp == 0
        print exit message
    if inp == 1
        do path = getPath()
        while(file == null) //or some other check for validity

        TO-DO:
        Decide whether to error check for null in loop in main

    if inp == 2
        make sure path exists
            check if path exists
            if not
                call get path
        print hierarchy
            walk files
            print each new file
    
    if inp == 3
        verify valid path is being used
        set the path as the root/where we will look within
        get file name
            use scanner to get file name
            make sure file exists
            if so
                assign the value to currentFile

        if file exists in the assigned path
            print contents of that file

                read a line of the file
                create int array the size of the line

                for every index value from 0 to array length
                    array[i] = (int) line.charAt(i)
                
                create String array size of the int array


                for each index in String array
                    array[i] = Integer.toHexString(int array[i])
                

                -------------------------------------------------
                byte[] = Files.readAllBytes(currentFile)



        else
            tell user file does not exist
            prompt again

    if inp == 4
        verify valid path is being used
        get file name
        if file exists in hierarchy
            delete that file
        else
            tell user file does not exist
            prompt again
    
    if inp == 5
        verify valid path is being used
        get file name
        if file exists in hierarchy
            read contents into buffer
            mirror bytes
        else
            tell user file does not exist
            prompt again
















    if inp == 2
        print exit message
    if inp == 3
        print exit message
    if inp == 4
        print exit message
    if inp == 5
        print exit message
