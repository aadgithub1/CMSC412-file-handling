User Interface
    Allow the user to select a number
        print the number options
        print a message directing the user to make a selection
        use a scanner to recieve the user's input
        print the number to ensure proper data capture

        Only allow user to select numbers 0-5
            convert user input to String
                handle any exceptions this may raise
            verify the input is between 0 and 5 inclusive
                if so return

Model
    Perform an operation based on user input
    Create a place for the file path to be stored to verify validity: File file

    if inp == 0
        print exit message
    if inp == 1
        do path = getPath()
        while(file == null) //or some other check for validity

        TO-DO:
        Decide whether to error check for null in loop in main















    if inp == 2
        print exit message
    if inp == 3
        print exit message
    if inp == 4
        print exit message
    if inp == 5
        print exit message
